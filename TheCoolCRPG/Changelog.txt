Extension Necessary:
- Passive Attacking with stats
(Example: you use an item or weapon, and that gives you a passive attack stat of 5. Now when you find an enemy, that enemy automatically takes 5 damage without being alerted of your presence.)
(Furthermore, if you use a new weapon that would normally give passive attack stats, that weapon would override your previous passive attack stats.)
